 #Course:
 
 ###Prerequisite:

 1)Calculus (Review the topic from net when required)
 2)Linear Algebra (Book List 1)
 3)Signal Processing (Review the topic from net when required)
 4)Probability and Statistics (Read the topic from net when encountered) 

 ####Book List 1:
1)MATLAB Demystified - David McMahon (Must Read, Covers most mathematical topics required in MATLAB)

2)Linear Algebra and Introduction to MATLAB - Sabine Eschenhof (Must Complete parallel to Book 1)
3)  Introduction to Numerical Methods and Matlab Programming for Engineers - Todd Young and Martin J. Mohlenkamp (Optional)
4)Linear Algebra - Jim Hefferon (Optional, for indepth theoretical knowledge in Linear Algebra)

N.B:We will mostly focus on book 1 and book 2, we will practice almost all the important matlab code snippets covered here. 

Time frame: We must complete all the pre-requisite before 8 March. (10 days)
